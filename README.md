# Count Models for Overdispersed Data

This folder contains the functions to: 

1) Jagger_Elsner.mat--> Function to calculate the seasonal count of events using the approach proposed by Jagger and Elsner (2012) 
   This method requires the previous observations as well as setting specific covariates as predictors.

3) HNB --> Function to calculate seasonal counts using a proposed Hurdle Shifted Negative Binomial model by fitting only the previus count observations.
